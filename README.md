# Keyboard-Counter

A simple windows forms app that counts keyboard press on defined buttons while the timer is running. 

I built this counter in order to sum up the number of classifications i did for an AI app (D, O, U are shortcuts for the classification proccess) 

The code uses a keyboard listener that invokes when a key is pressed than reports that it did not took care of the event so the regular use of the key will be happen next.
